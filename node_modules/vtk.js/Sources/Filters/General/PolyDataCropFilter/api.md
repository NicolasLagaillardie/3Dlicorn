## Introduction

The vtkImageCropFilter will crop a vtkImageData. This will only crop against
IJK-aligned planes.

Note this is slow on large datasets due to CPU-bound cropping.

## croppingPlane (get/set, array length 6)

The cropping plane, in vector + point coords. Defaults to [1, 0, 0, max(getBounds[0\],getBounds[1\]), 0, 0].
